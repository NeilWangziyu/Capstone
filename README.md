## Goal
The principle of mirror therapy (MT) is the use of a
mirror to create a reflective illusion of an affected limb
in order to trick the brain into thinking movement has
occurred without pain.

It involves placing the affected limb behind a mirror,
which is sited so the reflection of the opposing limb
appears in place of the hidden limb

## Results

#### Preliminary Deliverable
Implement a virtual hand real-time animation on an application after gesture recognition by machine learning on cloud.
       
#### Short-term Deliverables
To make the system good at recognizing ten typical gestures and meet the precision requirements as the therapy gestures.
     
#### Long-term Deliverable
To improve algorithm and hardware such as bracelet and increase signal collecting channels and improve the signal processing,making the devices dynamically implement mirror therapy, instead of being limited to the above 10 gestures, making it more perfect and easier to popularize.
